# How to use
1. Unarchive datapack (https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/) and put `translate.exe` into `data/blazeandcave/advancements/` folder
2. Unarchive language pack (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/bacap-language-pack/) and put language file you want to folder from previous step.
3. Run `translate.exe` and enter language file name.
4. All files translated. If you started in the terminal, then you will see the names of files for which there is no translation.
# Why?
I don't want to make players install resource packs.
